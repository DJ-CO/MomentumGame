# MomentumGame
This is a collection of code written for a momentum-based platforming game I started making for Unreal Engine 4. The game is based around momentum; it uses the character’s velocity to calculate the normal force the they experiences upon touching any surface, giving them a realistic amount of usable friction for turning, wall running, wall jumping, and other things. UE4 is said to be finicky with Git, so this repository houses copies of the game’s source, not the originals that are used by the engine. I will test using Git with UE4 later, in a controlled setting.
